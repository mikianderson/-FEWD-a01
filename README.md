##Miki Anderson Introductions
Hi everybody! My name is **Miki**.

I am from Japan. I came to this country as an _au pair_, an exchange culture program.
I spent 2 years with my host family in Washington D.C.
I really enjoyed my time there, especially biking and the cherry blossom festival. The Cherry blossom reminded me of
my country, it was very beautiful.

I have an 18 month old daughter, her name is **sarah**.
The chinese character that is used to write her name in Japanese means beautiful cherry blossom.
In Japan the cherry blossom is very famous, that is why I wanted to use that character in her name.
She is very social girl, love foods and love singing. Her first word was _**ball!**_.

Here is my daughter's pictures.
